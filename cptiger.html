	<h1>Tiger Escapes Central Park Zoo, NYPD Reports</h1>
	<p> A bengal tiger by the name of Lois has escaped the Central Park Zoo, according to an NYPD report released at 3:15 pm today.</p>
	<p>Authorities have yet to capture the 5 year old wild cat. The tiger reportedly made it into the 5th Avenue subway station, where the NRW trains stop. Commuters dodged out of the cat's way as it charged through the station, where witnesses say Lois jumped down into the tracks and disappeared into the dark tunnels of the New York subway system.</p>
	<p>"I couldn't believe my eyes," said John Doe, 39, who was coincidentally en route to the Central Park Zoo with his 6 year old daughter, Lea. "I grabbed Lea and ran. I had never seen something run with such ferocity."</p>
